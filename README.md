### How is Python used in data science?
Python is open source, interpreted, high level language and provides great approach for object-oriented programming. It is one of the best language used by data scientist for various data science projects/application. Python provide great functionality to deal with mathematics, statistics and scientific function.

### Which Python is best for data science?
Top 10 Python Libraries for Data Science
TensorFlow.
NumPy.
SciPy.
Pandas.

### Is Python for data science easy?
It's Easy to Learn
This ease of learning makes Python an ideal tool for beginning programmers. Python offers programmers the advantage of using fewer lines of code to accomplish tasks than one needs when using older languages. In other words, you spend more time playing with it and less time dealing with code.

### How much Python do you need to know for data science?
You should be familiar with widely used data types, integers (int), floats (float), strings (str), and booleans (bool). The next step is to learn compound data types (lists, tuples, and dictionaries). Conditions and Branching: Python uses boolean variables to assess conditions

### Is Python or C++ better for data science?
Also, if you are comparing in terms of competitive programming, then C++ would be better to choose, as it is much faster than Python. If you are into developing embedded systems, then C++ gets an upper hand here, whereas if you are into deep learning, ML, or data analysis, then no doubt Python wins here.

### Should I learn R or Python first?
In the context of biomedical data science, learn Python first, then learn enough R to be able to get your analysis done, unless the lab that you're in is R-dependent, in which case learn R and fill in the gaps with enough Python for easier scripting purposes. If you learn both, you can R code into Python using rpy.
